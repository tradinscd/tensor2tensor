"""A simple invertible tokenizer.

Converts from a raw string to a list of tokens (strings).

This tokenizer has the following desirable properties:
 - It is invertible.
 - Punctuation is broken away from adjacent letters.
 - A single space between words does not produce an extra token.

The tokenization algorithm is as follows:

0.  We classify the 256 characters into "word characters" and
    "separator characters".  Separator characters are defined as the union of
    string.punctuation and string.whitespace.  All other characters are
    "word characters".

1.  Split the text into a list of tokens, splitting at every boundary of a
    "word character" and a "separator character".  This produces a list which
    alternates between "word tokens" (strings of word characters) and
    "separator tokens" (strings of of separator characters).

2.  Remove every token consisting of a single space, unless it is
    the very first or very last token in the list.  These tokens are now
    implied by the fact that there are two adjacent word tokens.

e.g.  "Dude - that's so cool."
        -> ["Dude", " - ", "that", "'", "s", "so", "cool", "."]
