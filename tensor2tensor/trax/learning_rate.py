  """Default learning rate  schedule.

  Note: the learning rate schedule takes arguments and return a function,
  learning_rate: step -> lr, that only takes a step and return the rate.
  The reason is that learning_rate(step) is called at every training step,
  so should be efficient, while the schedule is re-computed only when
  evaluating the model, so usually only every 100 or 1000 steps.

  Interprets factors in the schedule string which can consist of:
  * constant: interpreted as the constant value,
  * linear_warmup: interpreted as linear warmup until warmup_steps,
  * rsqrt_decay: divide by square root of max(step, warmup_steps)

  Args:
    history: the history of training and evaluation (History object).
    schedule: a string with factors separated by "*" that defines the schedule.
    constant: float, the starting constant for the learning rate schedule.
    warmup_steps: how many steps to warm up for in the warmup schedule.

  Returns:
    a function learning_rate(step): float -> float, the step-dependent lr.
